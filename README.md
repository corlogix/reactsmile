## Pull request
Create a pull-request from your `'feature'` or `'bugfix'` branch to the `'main'` branch.

Code owners will review the pull-request and merge when approved.

## Creating a release

Once your `pull-request` is merged into the `'main'` branch, the Code Owners will create a `"releases"` branch. This is the only branch which pushes new versions to the NPM repository.
